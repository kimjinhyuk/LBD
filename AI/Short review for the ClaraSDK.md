### Short review for the ClaraSDK

ClaraSDK - An Application Framework Optimized for Healthcare and Life Sciences Developers

During the Nvidia dreamAI Hackaton there is a session about ***Nvidia Clara SDK*** which is a healthcare application framework for AI-powered imaging, genomics, and for the development and deployment of smart sensors. It includes full-stack GPU-accelerated libaries, SDK and referencee applications for developers, data scientists and researches to create real-time, secure and scalable solutions.

Especially it has very suit for my project in Gwang Ju Ai institute so for the first time i had experience high performance GPU It was kind of cool. Obviously, most of libraries and development environments systems are not familiar at the first time, also so many session disturbtion. also i have not realised that so many people use the Pytouch. it was kind of brainstorming.. to me.
